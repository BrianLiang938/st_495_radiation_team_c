# ST495 Radiation Team C

## Team Members
Amanda Baright, Nishant Dodla, Brian Liang, Srisai Pusuluri, and David Salgado

## Goals
For this project we will be working with raw data from the ACC Cancer Center to create statistical models that predict errors and mistakes in radiation therapy treatments. Through these models our goal is to predict the errors before they occur and help prevent future errors from occuring. One of our biggest tasks in this project will be to effectively clean the data as the features of our statistical models are found in multiple data sources. Additionally, within this data cleaning process we will want to parse through the ID variable to identify the category, subcategory, and attribute of the error. We’ll then utilize the statistical learning techniques we’ve learned during this semester to create models to predict error categories and when the error occurs.
